		I've been changin'. But the burnin' stays the same. What can I do to tame the heat of this fire?. Forever savin'. The remnants of a love. Like ancient stories told from another time. Eternally painted on my mind. Mmm. Color it gray. Until I forget you. Like I never met you. My dearest Clementine. Throw it away. But close enough to you. 'Cause although I hate you. I will still fall in love, my Clementine. Every time, mmm. And if you're fadin'. Then honey I'll be fadin' too. Darling, I don't even know who I am without you. Forever waitin'. Times never wasted and still. I find myself growin' old over you. You came in a dream. You touched the depths of my mind. Oh, no, no, no. Color it gray. Until I forget you. Like I never met you. My dearest Clementine. Throw it away. But close enough to you. 'Cause although I hate you. I will still fall in love, my Clementine. Every time, always. No matter how hard I try.

I know a place where we can. Dance the night away. Baby, we could try to. Make the world spin slower. We could take our time and. Get to know each other over cherry wine, huh.

So please just have me for tonight? Huh. Dance. Yeah, I said let's dance the night away. Baby, we could try to. Make the world spin slower. We could take our time and. Get to know each other over cherry wine. Oh, I, dance the night away. Baby we could try to. Make the world spin slower. We could take our time, uh. Know it's too soon to say you're mine. Let's have a little drink tonight. And get to know each other over cherry wine. I've been changin'. But the burnin' stays the same. What can I do to tame the heat of this fire?. Forever savin'. The remnants of a love. Like ancient stories told from another time. Eternally painted on my mind. Mmm. Color it gray. Until I forget you. Like I never met you. My dearest Clementine. Throw it away. But close enough to you. 'Cause although I hate you. I will still fall in love, my Clementine. Every time, mmm. And if you're fadin'. Then honey I'll be fadin' too. Darling, I don't even know who I am without you. Forever waitin'. Times never wasted and still. I find myself growin' old over you. You came in a dream. You touched the depths of my mind. Oh, no, no, no. Color it gray. Until I forget you. Like I never met you. My dearest Clementine. Throw it away. But close enough to you. 'Cause although I hate you. I will still fall in love, my Clementine. Every time, always. No matter how hard I try. My Clementine, every time. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Color it gray. Until I forget you. Like I never met you.

Mmm, mmm. You're always on my mind. Why you standing all by yourself?. Those shoes were made for dancing with someone else. Why don't we move over to that empty space?. I bet you 20 bucks I'll put a smile on your face. I know a place where we can. Dance the night away. Baby, we could try to. Make the world spin slower. We could take our time and. Get to know each other over cherry wine, huh. Well, it's so soon to give up on tonight, uh. I haven't had the chance to show you my moves and I. I think you'd like to see why they would call me Mr. Dynamite. I can show while we dance the night away. Baby, we could try to. Make the world spin slower. We could take our time and. Get to know each other over cherry wine. I've been waiting on this dance. Floor made for two babe. Won't you show me just what you can do?. I don't wanna waste your time.
